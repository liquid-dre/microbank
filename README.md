### üß† Developer Thoughts

I wanted to share a bit about my journey building this project:

I had never worked with JWT directly before (I usually rely on Clerk for personal projects), so that was a bit challenging at first.
But if there‚Äôs anything I believe in, it‚Äôs my ability to see a problem through‚Äîand, of course, read documentation ü§£.
	‚Ä¢	Saturday: I started the project in the morning, and by the time I went to sleep, the core functionalities were done.
	‚Ä¢	Sunday: I realized I had misread the required project structure, which meant restructuring imports and cleaning up my backend code.
	‚Ä¢	This turned out to be a blessing in disguise, as I got to refactor my lib/api.ts for cleaner and easier API calls and made a bunch of styling changes just to put my own personal touch and favourite colour (green)

I also reflected on real-world practicality:

Letting users just pick any deposit amount felt unrealistic without a verification step to ensure they actually had the funds.
I almost redesigned the project to focus on withdrawals & transfers instead, but in the end I stuck to the brief‚Äîimagining a system like Apple Pay or a linked e-wallet handling the actual funds.

The short timeframe was actually exhilarating:
	‚Ä¢	Friday night: Designed my screens and DB schema
	‚Ä¢	Saturday & Sunday: Built and refined the core app
	‚Ä¢	Deployment: Of course, everything went haywire at first üòÖ, but debugging and fixing that was its own kind of fun.

Overall, I enjoyed every part of the process, and I hope the effort and care I put into this project comes through to anyone who inspects the repo or tries the app.
